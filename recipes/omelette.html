		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>A classic omelette is a quick and versatile dish perfect for breakfast, brunch, or even a light dinner. It's fluffy, savory, and can be filled with your favorite vegetables, cheese, or meats. This simple recipe provides the base for a perfectly cooked omelette, ready to be customized to your taste.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2-3 large eggs</li>
			<li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1-2 tablespoons of milk or water (optional, for fluffier eggs)</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
			<li>Fillings of choice (e.g., shredded cheese, chopped bell peppers, spinach, mushrooms, diced tomatoes, or cooked ham)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them thoroughly until well blended. Add a pinch of salt, black pepper, and the milk or water if using. Whisk again to incorporate.
</li>
			<li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the butter or oil. Swirl to coat the pan evenly.</li>
			<li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan, tilting it slightly to spread the eggs out evenly. Let it cook undisturbed for 1-2 minutes until the edges start to set.</li>
			<li>Using a spatula, gently lift the edges and tilt the pan to allow any uncooked egg to flow to the edges.</li>
			<li>Once the omelette is almost set but still slightly runny on top, add your desired fillings evenly over one half of the omelette.</li>
			<li>Fold the omelette in half using the spatula and cook for an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute until the cheese is melted and the eggs are fully cooked.</li>
			<li>Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately.</li>
		</ol>
