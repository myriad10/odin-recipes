		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Oatmeal is a warm, hearty breakfast thatâ€™s packed with fiber and can be customized to suit any taste. This classic oatmeal recipe is simple, nutritious, and can be adapted with various toppings for endless breakfast possibilities.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup rolled oats (old-fashioned or quick oats)</li>
			<li>2 cups water or milk (for a creamier texture, use milk or a milk alternative like almond or oat milk)</li>
			<li>A pinch of salt</li>
			<li>Sweetener to taste (optional: honey, maple syrup, or brown sugar)</li>
		</ul>
